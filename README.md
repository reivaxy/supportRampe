# Aquarium light bracket

This is a replacement for a big and clumsy bracket to hold an aquarium lamp. It is designed to not touch the water so that no salt deposit will occur due to capillarity.

I printed several, using ABS and PETG.

Better not use PLA.

I printed this vertically, with the help of support, I think it's more resistant to the effort it is subject to, and also due to the lenght difference of the two "legs".
